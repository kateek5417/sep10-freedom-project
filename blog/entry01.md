## Veterinary
I decided to focus on veterinary technology for this project because all my life I've been interested in animals and biology since I was a child. I used to be obsessed with animals when I was younger so this was one of the first options that came to mind when deciding on a research topic. I also thought about researching on my newer hobby of art but I ultimately decided to stay with veterinary. That being said, I still poked around on the technology in art and came across ["How Technology is Changing the Art World"](https://www.pinotspalette.com/naperville/blog/creative-life/-pinotspalettenaperville-art-and-technology-how-technology-is-changing-the-art-world#:~:text=Digital%20art%20uses%20digital%20technology,projectors%2C%20and%20other%20digital%20platforms.) by Pinot's Palette Naperville. But the articles that caught my eye when googling about veterinary technology were ["How Changing Technology is Helping Veterinary Medicine and Practice"](https://www.vetport.com/technology-helping-veterinary-medicine) by VETPort and ["Technological Innovations Veterinarians Should be Integrating with Their Practice"](https://talkatoo.com/blog/6-technological-innovations-veterinarians-should-be-integrating-with-their-practice-right-now/) by Talkatoo because it was only after reading through these articles did I realize how medical technology used in human hosptials are also being used in similar ways in animal hospitals. Seeing the connection between medical procedures for humans and animals made me curious about how advanced machinery  fitted to the physical capacities of humans was altered to the capacities and physicalities of smaller animals. 

## Engineering Design Process
Right now I am on the first step of the Engineering Design Process which is to define a problem about veterinary technology, then move on to step 2 and research the problem. I think I will linger on these two steps for a little more to think about problems related to veterinary technology and how to solve it.

## Skills
While writing this blog, I improved on my **How To Read** skill. When I read on my own spare time I normally focus on each word and sentence to analyze what they mean and what it means to the plot, but when I do so for school readings I find that I get bored faster and end up getting side tracked on another task or just end up procrastinating on the assignment entirely. So recently instead of focusing on each word all at once, I skim the article for the general idea of the text, then I break down the article into smaller parts and take my time to understand its content.

Another skill I worked on was my **Time Management** skill. These past few weeks I've realized that I'm always on a time crunch, being on the swim team and the endless amount of assignments my classes are assigning this year leaves me no room to breathe. I've developed a kind of routine where on calmer days, I go home during 8th period lunch to complete my homework before going to practice, but on days where I have a lot of work, I end up spending my lunch period at the library where I focus on my assignments before rushing home and to practice, I've even considered on bringing my chromebook to work while commuting to and from practice. On days where I am really exhausted after practice, I make sure I get up a little earlier the next morning to finish up any incomplete work.

## What's Next?
I am looking to continue my research on veterinary technology and creating my own website!
