Tool: **Animate.css**

* I practiced applying animations to my html by using them on one of my old projects, the movie webpage. I create my own copy so I could tinker without worrying about breaking something on the official project. The webpage was for a horror movie so I wanted to add some animations for some spooky ambiance while also drawing the viewer's attention on certain things like the title of the movie.
* I added a pulse animation to the title with `animate__animated animate__pulse`, repeated it twice with `animate__repeat-2`, and slowed it down with `animate__slower` to give it a floating-ghost feel to it.
* I also added a fade in animation with `animate__fadeIn` for a `<span>` to give it a mysterious effect
