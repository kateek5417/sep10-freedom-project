### In Class Presentation
For my in-class presentation, I think I did pretty okay overall because while there are areas in which I could improve on, I feel like I was able to present the information I needed to present in a way that the audience could understand without messing up too much. Even though I was nervous, I was still able to project my presentation and remember what I had to say without stuttering or pausing for long periods of time. Compared to earlier presentations, I felt a little more confident and prepared to present.

### Expo-Elevator Pitch
For my Expo-Elevator Pitch, I felt like I slowly improved on my pitch the more I presented because it kind of served as practice before I had to present to the judges. By the time I had to face the judges, I had already given my pitch several times, helping my memorize my pitch more and boosting my confidence even if I was still a little nervous. Overall, I was able to quickly give my pitch about my website and my process without any problems. However, one thing I would work on next time is how I end my pitches because I think that my pitches ended too abruptly without a flow to stop.

### Challenge
A challenge I had while presenting in-class and during the Expo was my anxiety and nervousness. Everytime when I present or gave my pitch my heart rate would skyrocket and I would get a little shaky. Though I do still get nervous while presenting and speaking publicly, I feel that I am slowly improving and my anxiety does not flare up as much as I used to.

### Takeaways
Overall, this entire project had been a great experience for me, not just academically but it also helps me prepare for the real world after I graduate. The experience of creating my own work, then presenting it to crowds of people will help me get accustomed to the feeling of presenting and speaking to people in the future. It also helps me work on my public speaking abilities and allows me to reflect back onto what I need to improve for the future.

### Engineering Design Process
Currently in the Engineering Design Process, I am at the point where I communicate my project
