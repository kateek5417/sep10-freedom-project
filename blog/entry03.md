Future Veterinary Tech 12/22/23

## Brainstorming Technology
After researching about the current veterinary technology we have now, I now have to brainstorm veterinary tech for the future. It is important that we look into the future of veterinary in order to improve and advance our medicine and technology to ensure the health of our pets. To do that, I thought about the technology we have today, what we might need improvements on, and what can help people in better ways. I was able to come up with a number of possible future tech that will help improve and maintain the health of our pets. 

Some of them are:
* Delivery drones
* Recovery Plan App
* Calming machines
* 3D holograms and simulations
* Ai prosthetic limbs

#### Delivery Drones
The technology of using quick [drones as a method of delivery](https://www.wipro.com/business-process/the-future-of-delivery-with-drones-contactless-accurate-and-high-speed/) is already happening around the world today but I want to improve them to be more efficient. Orders for more prescribed medication can be placed by the patient or by the doctor, these orders can be tracked by both doctor and patient through email or application. The light weight solar charged drones will be quick in delivery and eco-friendly. We can also explore the possibility of having emergency care drones that will pick up and deliver pets that are in need of emergency care like an ambulance.

#### Recovery Plan App
Last time we researched about current vet technology and we came across an [app that tracked the patient's vitals](https://bionetus.com/vet/veterinary-multi-parameter-monitors/bt-link-veterinary-monitor-mobile-app/) as well as the use of AI to diagnostics mentioned in this [article about AI in veterinary medicine.](https://www.avma.org/news/artificial-intelligence-veterinary-medicine-what-are-ethical-and-legal-implications) I had the idea of combing both functions to create an app that will use the vitals of the patient to map out a recovery plan. The app will constantly read and store the vital signs of the patient to calculate an accurate path of recovery for the animal, any sudden changes will be noted and calculations will also change based on the information. Additionally, if the app detects any dangerous vitals, the doctor and owner will be notified and will request for immediate action.

## EDP
In the engineering design process, the step that follows researching is brainstorming solutions for the problem. In order to brainstorm about what lays ahead for veterinary technology, I first had to think about our current technology, how it helps doctors, how it helps pet owners, and how it benefits our pets. Then I thought about what could be improved to make things easier to keep pets healthy. I also improved on our current technology by combing certain functions together to make something more advanced and high-tech that will moniter the status of pets. After I am finished with the brainstorming step I will move onto the planning stage.

## Skills
One skills that I used in this experience was my creativity. In order to brainstorm possible future tech, I had to be creative and open minded to any possibilities. I wrote down any *"what ifs"* and ideas that I had into creations. I remembered the high-tech machines in sci-fi movies that I watched and used those to inspire my thoughts. I took advice and suggestion from peers and built onto those ideas even further with my own.

Another skill I practiced was organization. After my prior research of existing technology and my brainstorm of future technology, I had to organize my notes into a neater and labeled format. For part A, I organized my technology into 'Applications' 'AI' and 'Hardware' as well as including the websites from where I got the information.

* Intro 
  * Nowadays, technology plays a crucial role in the health of our beloved pets. From little things like making appointments, filing information, to huge machines for X-rays and scans, none of it would be possible without technology. Hence why it is important for vets and pet lovers alike to know about technology which will help play large roles in keeping their little friends safe.

Current tech
