## Veterinary
I decided to focus on veterinary technology for this project because all my life I've been interested in animals and biology since I was a child. I'm always curious and open to learn more regarding topics that interests me and I think that learning more about how technology plays a part veterinary will help me understand just how much advanced technology impacts and affects the health of our pets. Since I used to be obssesed with animals when I was younger, this was one of the first options that came to mind when deciding on a research topic. I also thought about researching on my newer hobby of art but I ultimately decided to continue my obssesion of animals. That being said, I still poked around on the technology in art and came across ["How Technology is Changing the Art World"](https://www.pinotspalette.com/naperville/blog/creative-life/-pinotspalettenaperville-art-and-technology-how-technology-is-changing-the-art-world#:~:text=Digital%20art%20uses%20digital%20technology,projectors%2C%20and%20other%20digital%20platforms.)
