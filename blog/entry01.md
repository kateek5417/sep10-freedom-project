## Veterinary
I decided to focus on veterinary technology for this project because all my life I've been interested in animals and biology since I was a child. I used to be obssesed with animals when I was younger so this was one of the first options that came to mind when deciding on a research topic. I also thought about researching on my newer hobby of art but I ultimately decided to stay with veterinary. That being said, I still poked around on the technology in art and came across ["How Technology is Changing the Art World"](https://www.pinotspalette.com/naperville/blog/creative-life/-pinotspalettenaperville-art-and-technology-how-technology-is-changing-the-art-world#:~:text=Digital%20art%20uses%20digital%20technology,projectors%2C%20and%20other%20digital%20platforms.) by Pinot's Palette Naperville. But the articles that caught my eye when googling about veterinary technology were ["How Changing Technology is Helping Veterinary Medicine and Practice"](https://www.vetport.com/technology-helping-veterinary-medicine) by VETPort and ["Technological Innovations Veterinarians Should be Integrating with Their Practice"](https://talkatoo.com/blog/6-technological-innovations-veterinarians-should-be-integrating-with-their-practice-right-now/) by Talkatoo because it was only after reading through these articles did I realize how medical technology used in human hosptials are also being used in similar ways in animal hospitals. Seeing the connection between medical procedures for humans and animals made me curious about how advanced machinary  fitted to the physical capacities of humans was altered to the capacities and physicalities of smaller animals. 

## Engineering Design Process
Right now I am on the first step of the Engineering Design Process which is to define the problem, then move on to step 2 and research the problem.
