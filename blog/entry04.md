Animate.css Tool 2/26/24

## Animate.css
For my Freedom Project the tool that I have decided to stick with is [Animate.css](https://animate.style/). Animate.css uses `html` classes and `css` properties to assign and customize animations from the animate.css library onto elements. In my CS50 IDE I played around with changing the animation's durations and delays using the html `animate__delay` class and the css `animation-duration` property. With animate.css, an element's animation is determined with classes provided by the library and in order for the animations to function, the classes must include the class `animate__animated` followed by the actual animation type. For example: `<h1 class="animate__animated animate__backInUp">`. Additionally, because some of the animations cause the elements to move outside of their parent box they cause scroll bars to form on the right and bottom side of the screen which can be distracting and unappealing. To get rid of the srcroll bars I used the [overflow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow) property and the `hidden` value to hide the content that exceeds the parent container.

## EDP
After researching and brainstorming about veterinary, I am currently planning out the tools and knowledge that I will need in order to build my final project website. I have to plan out how I will incorporate this tool that I have chosen into my website as well as how to use it properly to really capture the viewer's attention without being distracting.

## Skills
One skill that I practiced while choosing my tool was my collaboration skill because after I chose animate.css to tinker with I had some issues with getting the tool to work so I consulted with my friend who had used the same tool before. When I first tried out the tool, the code would not produce what I wanted it to, the animations were not working so I double checked all of the classes and properties I used. After doubling checking my animation codes with the official Animate.css website and didn't find anything wrong with it, I reached out to my friend for help. In the end, with a few code comparisons and tests it had turned out that I copied the animate.css's library incorrectly meaning the program could not properly access the animation codes.

Another skill that I used was my skill of embracing failure because the process of tinkering naturally involves a lot of trial and error. As I tinkered, I experimented with the animation codes, testing what I could so and what I couldn't do. As I was still learning how to use the tool, I would type the wrong code in wrong locations or I would forget and combine different classes into one.

## What's next?
After testing and choosing the tool that I will use in my project I will then start to plan how to implement animate.css into my project to really make it pop.
