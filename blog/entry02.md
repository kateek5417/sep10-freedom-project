## Research
Now that I have identified the problem that most people are uninformed about veterinary technology, my next step is to research about how people are affected by this and on how to solve this problem. To start off, the issue with people not being informed about vet technology can be bad for the health of their pets. There countless reliable apps for pet owners and upcoming vets that inform the user about possible ailments, basic health care and monitoring, along with procedures during emergencies. Some websites and apps have programs or [classes](https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/first-aid/cat-dog-first-aid) where people can be educated on the health of their pets. There are also apps that help with quick [communication](https://otto.vet/) between other vets and their patients which can be helpful for dire situations, questions, and easy accessibility. It is crucial that people are educated on the well being of their beloved pets to ensure them a good life, and one good method is through informative veterinary apps and websites.

## EDP
After the first step of identifing the main problem that people are uninformed about the world of veterinary technology, I am now in the second step of the egineering design process. Right now I am researching how the people's lack of knowledge on the world of veterinary technology can impact the health of their pets by using articles and websites on the internet. After researching about the effects of the problem, I will move on to the third step and begin brainstorming on how to solve the problem.

## Skills
One skill that I used during this experience was consideration. When writing about the affects of the problem on pet owners I had to consider the contents and use of the technology as well as how the use of said technology would benefit pet owners. I also had to consider what the affects would be if the problem were not solved.

Another skill I used for this step was collaboration. While I was thinking about the benefits of the technology I researched and the affects of the problem, I decided to take another opinion and asked my friend what they thought.  Their insight on informing people about veterinary technology gave me ideas on what I should add to the blog.

## What's Next?
After identifying the problem, the next part of the egineering desgin process would to be start brainstorming possible solutions for informing people about vet apps.
