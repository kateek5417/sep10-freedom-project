              This project is about performance arts. Performance arts has 4 main categories, dance, art, music, and theater. This will mainly focus on dance and theater. Dance has many categories. From modern, to ballet, to hip hop and many more. Dance has evolved by having new technology advance the way it can be portrayed.Theater also has meny categories, from drama, to play, comedy, tragedy, melodrama, ect. One thing both things have in common is that they usualy need to change clothes. Which is why i have a few ideas that can improve performance arts.

          <h4 class="animate__animated animate__bounce">Part A</h4>
            <p>For part A we had to research about the ways technology was used before until now. Dance technology has evolved significantly over the years, from simple tools like metronomes and dance notation systems to sophisticated motion capture and projection mapping technologies, video, computer programs, teaching classes online, etc.In the past, dance was often taught for  traditional or physical use . However, dance was developed to create a written language so dance could be used to show/explain a story, aesthetic ideas and emotions as a form of performance art presented to an audience. </p>

                <div class="col-4">Cameras<br>Cameras are used to either record to remember a specifc memory or to practicea certain videoyou might of have recorded. Cameras also can be used to take pictures.</div>
                <div class="col-4">Lights<br>Dance uses big lights to make sure that the main characters or main dancers are on the spotlight/main focus.</div>

            <h4 class="animate__animated animate__bounce ">Part B</h4>


          <p>For part B we had to come up with our own ideas to improve the technology on our topic.Dance technology is an ever-evolving field, and there are many exciting developments on the horizon. Here are some potential ways that dance technology could develop in the future.</p>

          <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-5">Hologram Floor<br>The hologram floor has to be sturdy enough to hold the weight of at least 20 people or more. You would have to insert a video for the program to process the video to project it. The purpose is so in the situation that a dacner is missing then the hologram would take their place so the people can still practice.</div>

              <div class="col-5">Fast Changing Room<br>The fast changing room id esseciallya room where there is a robot arm there to assit the person who is going to change more faster and keep production moving more faster.</div>
