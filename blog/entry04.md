Animate.css Tool 2/26/24

## Animate.css
For my Freedom Project the tool that I have decided to stick with is [Animate.css](https://animate.style/). Animate.css uses `html` classes and `css` properties to assign and customize animations from the animate.css library onto elements. In my CS50 IDE I played around with changing the animation's durations and delays using the html `animate__delay` class and the css `animation-duration` property. With animate.css, an element's animation is determined with classes provided by the library and in order for the animations to function, the classes must include the class `animate__animated` followed by the actual animation type. For example: `<h1 class="animate__animated animate__backInUp">`. Additionally, because some of the animations cause the elements to move outside of their parent box they cause scroll bars to form on the right and bottom side of the screen which can be distracting and unappealing. To get rid of the srcroll bars I used the [overflow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow) property and the `hidden` value to hide the content that exceeds the parent container.

## Skills
One skill that I practiced while choosing my tool was my collaboration skill because after I chose animate.css to tinker with I had some issues with getting the tool to work so I consulted with my friend who had used the same tool before. When I first tried out the tool, the code would not produce what I wanted it to, the animations were not working so I double checked all of the classes and properties I used. After doubling checking my animation codes with the official Animate.css website and didn't find anything wrong with it, I reached out to my friend for help. In the end, with a few code comparisons and tests it had turned out that I copied the animate.css's library incorrectly meaning the program could not properly access the animation codes.

Another skill that I used was my skill of embracing failure because the process of tinkering naturally involves a lot of trial and error.
