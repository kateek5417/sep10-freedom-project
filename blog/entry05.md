## What is Animate.style?
They way that the tool [Animate.style](https://animate.style/) works is through a variety of element classes that determines the animation as well as classes and properties that alter how the animation is displayed. For example, if I were to make it so the header were to slide in from the left, I would apply the `animate__slideInLeft` class to the header. It is crucial to make sure that the class `animate__animated` is also in the class in order for the animation to function.
```html
<hi class="animate__animated animate__slideInLeft"> Hello World </h1>
```
Then if I were delay the animation for 2 seconds and loop it infintely, I would add the `animate__delay-2s` and `animate__infinite` classes.
```html
<hi class="animate__animated animate__slideInLeft animate__delay-2s animate__infinite"> Hello World </h1>
```
However, different animations animate differently so adjustments can be made for corrections.

## How did I learn my tool?
To learn my tool I first read through the [Animate.style](https://animate.style/) website to gain a basic understanding of how the tool works. I then moved onto tinkering with the tool in my IDE workspace where I then messed around with the different classes and properties in Animate.style. I went through the animations that interested me and applied them onto basic elements.
```html
<h1 class="animate__animated animate__heartBeat"
<p class="animate__animated animate__flash"> Flash </p>
```

I continued to do this until I became comfortable with the animations and when I did, I moved onto the different customization classes and properties. I tried nearly all of the classes and properties that Animate.style offered and came across some issues I would then learn to overcome.

After animating simple elements such as paragraphs, `<p>`, and headers, `<h1>`, I decided to move onto something bigger and more complex so I practiced on past projects I did as well as [Bootstrap templates](https://startbootstrap.com/themes). 
For my tinkering on my SHABR project I created a copy of my original file into my sandbox folder where I could break any code I wanted to. There I applied a variety of animations where I thought would bring the website to life as well as to bring attention to certain aspects.
