Building my MVP

## My Building Process
The first thing that I did was create the title image and text as well as the navbar. I did this first so that I would have an idea of how the structure of the beginning and the content under it would go. And though I did plan my wireframe out previously, I had trouble envisioning my website until I built the header. After the header I focused on adding the main content and information of my topic  of my pages before I added anything else. I didn't want everything to be on one long page so I divided the different sections into different pages of Home, Present, and Future. As I worked I changed things a bit from the wireframe plans because I had different ideas while typing. When I finished adding the main texts and info for all three pages, I went back to my Present page to put the paragraphs into accordians and the functions of my future technology into bootstrap lists. Then I added the bootstrap cards at the bottom of all three pages as link cards.
