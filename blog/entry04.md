Animate.css Tool 2/26/24

## Animate.css
For my Freedom Project the tool that I have decided to stick with is [Animate.css](https://animate.style/). Animate.css uses `html` classes and `css` properties to assign and customize animations from the animate.css library onto elements. In my CS50 IDE I played around with changing the animation's durations and delays using the html `animate__delay` class and the css `animation-duration` property. With animate.css, an element's animation is determined with classes provided by the library and in order for the animations to function, the classes must include the class `animate__animated` followed by the actual animation type. For example: `<h1 class="animate__animated animate__backInUp">`. Additionally, because some of the animations cause the elements to move outside of their parent box they cause scroll bars to form on the right and bottom side of the screen which can be distracting and unappealing. To get rid of the srcroll bars I used the `overflow:hidden` property and value to hide the content that exceeds the parent container.
