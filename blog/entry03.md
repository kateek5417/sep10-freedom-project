Future Veterinary Tech 12/22/23

## Brainstorming Technology
After researching about the current veterinary technology we have now, I now have to brainstorm veterinary tech for the future. I thought about what tech we have today, what we might need improvements on, and what can help people in better ways. I was able to come up with a number of possible future tech that will help improve and maintain the health of our pets. 

Some of them are:
* Delivery drones
* Recovery Plan App
* Calming machines
* 3D holograms and simulations
* Ai prosthetic limbs

#### Delivery Drones
The technology of using quick [drones as a method of delivery](https://www.wipro.com/business-process/the-future-of-delivery-with-drones-contactless-accurate-and-high-speed/) is already happening around the world today but I want to improve them to be more efficient. Orders for more prescribed medication can be placed by the patient or by the doctor, these orders can be tracked by both doctor and patient through email or application. The light weight solar charged drones will be quick in delivery and eco-friendly. We can also explore the possibility of having emergency care drones that will pick up and deliver pets that are in need of emergency care like an ambulance.

#### Recovery Plan App
Last time we researched about current vet technology and we came across an [app that tracked the patient's vitals](https://bionetus.com/vet/veterinary-multi-parameter-monitors/bt-link-veterinary-monitor-mobile-app/) as well as the use of AI to diagnostics mentioned in this [article about AI in veterinary medicine.](https://www.avma.org/news/artificial-intelligence-veterinary-medicine-what-are-ethical-and-legal-implications) I had the idea of combing both functions to create an app that will use the vitals of the patient to map out a recovery plan. The app will constantly read and store the vital signs of the patient to calculate an accurate path of recovery for the animal, any sudden changes will be noted and calculations will also change based on the information. Additionally, if the app detects any dangerous vitals, the doctor and owner will be notified and will request for immediate action.
