# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Katee Ko**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of Veterinary. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study Animate.style in order to help me make by website.

## Implications
##### PROS
* The website can help introduce more people into the world of veternary medicine and broaden their personal interests.
* Those who gain an interest in veterinary medicine might decide to pursue it in the future, whether a doctor or a developer who focuses on the veterinary practice.
* Having more people be aware of the available veterinary technology might encourage people to further develope and advance the medical technology, benefitting not only veterinary medicine but other medical practices as well.
* The more people are informed about the available vet tech, the less likely they are to waste money on expensive gimmmick scams

##### CONS
* If people who viewed the website decided to pursue veterinary medicine and attend vet school, it would be extremely expensive and challenging as tuition costs alone could range between $80,000 and $285,000
