### Research
Now that I have identified the problem that most people are uninformed about veterinary technology, my next step is to research about how people are affected by this and on how to solve this problem. To start off, the issue with people not being informed about vet technology can be bad for the health of their pets. There countless reliable apps for pet owners and upcoming vets that inform the user about possible ailments, basic health care and monitoring, along with procedures during emergencies. Some websites and apps have programs or [classes](https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/first-aid/cat-dog-first-aid) where people can be educated on the health of their pets. There are also apps that help with quick [communication](https://otto.vet/) between other vets and their patients which can be helpful for dire situations, questions, and easy accessibility. It is crucial that people are educated on the well being of their beloved pets to ensure them a good life, and one good method is through informative veterinary apps and websites.

### EDP
After the first step of identifing the main problem that people are uninformed about the world of veterinary technology, I am now in the second step of the egineering design process. Right now I am researching how the people's lack of knowledge on the world of veterinary technology can impact the health of their pets by using articles and websites on the internet. After researching about the effects of the problem, I will move on to the third step and begin brainstorming on how to solve the problem.
