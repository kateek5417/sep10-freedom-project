            <div class="row">
                <p>The first school of veterinary medicine was established in the 1760s by Claude Bourgelat in Lyon, France. It wasn't until the past 30 years that veterinary medicine changed exponentially. Previously the only veterinary equipment availave for diagnosis was the x-ray and now we have long evolved into more complex technology such as digital x-ray, MRI, ultrasound, surgical technology, and more. </p>

            <div class="row">
                <p>As a result of the constant changes in technology, there has been an increase in diagnostic accuracy, therapy development, treatment effectiveness, and patient care. More illnesses and injuries can be healed as well as detected faster. This advancement in technology means a lot more animals are saved.</p>
