## What is Animate.style?
They way that the tool [Animate.style](https://animate.style/) works is through a variety of element classes that determines the animation as well as classes and properties that alter how the animation is displayed. For example, if I were to make it so the header were to slide in from the left, I would apply the `animate__slideInLeft` class to the header. It is crucial to make sure that the class `animate__animated` is also in the class in order for the animation to function.
```html
<hi class="animate__animated animate__slideInLeft"> Hello World </h1>
```
Then if I were delay the animation for 2 seconds and loop it infintely, I would add the `animate__delay-2s` and `animate__infinite` classes.
```html
<hi class="animate__animated animate__slideInLeft animate__delay-2s animate__infinite"> Hello World </h1>
```
However, different animations animate differently so adjustments can be made for corrections.
