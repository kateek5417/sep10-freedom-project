Building my MVP

## My Building Process
The first thing that I did was create the title image and text as well as the navbar. I did this first so that I would have an idea of how the structure of the beginning and the content under it would go. And though I did plan my wireframe out previously, I had trouble envisioning my website until I built the header. After the header I focused on adding the main content and information of my topic  of my pages before I added anything else. I didn't want everything to be on one long page so I divided the different sections into different pages of Home, Present, and Future. As I worked I changed things a bit from the wireframe plans because I had different ideas while typing. When I finished adding the main texts and info for all three pages, I went back to my Present page to put the paragraphs into accordians and the functions of my future technology into bootstrap lists. Then I added the bootstrap cards at the bottom of all three pages as link cards.

## Header
For my header I went with my go to title over a background image style and I found some inspiration for my title's style at [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_transparent.asp). For my titles I used the help of W3school's [image over text](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_text.asp) to have my text appear on top of the image as well as being centered in the middle. 
``` css
.title-text {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    color: #f1f1f1;
}
```
Then to have a dark background opacity for the title I once again used the help of W3school:
``` css
.text-background {
    background: rgb(0, 0, 0);
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
    padding: 30px;
}
```
